							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article discusses the accessibility issues one must consider when picking colors.  It makes it clear how common place visual impairments are (217 million +).
								Reasons to consider this are not just the ethical issue of accessibility, but also to avoid lawsuits and also to make your product as consumable to as many people as possible. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article does a great job of providing resources to follow up with.  In particular I liked the discussion on InVision Craft and and WCAG 2.1.  Both these make me feel confident I can think critically about my design and make it accessible. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
